## VIVA Front-End Take Home Challenge

Please create a simple website that supports an extremely simple loan application.

### My implementation

- I've implemeted most all the required functionality and added functionality and adjustments of my own. The only requirement I neglected is disabling the button when input fails validation and this was due to me simply running out of time today as I will be busy the rest of the day this Friday September 23rd.

### How to Run

- I've hosted the app on github pages so running the react project locally is not necessary. Simply follow the link in the description of this project. If running the project locally is still necessary, all you'd have to do is clone this repository and install react on your local machine, then run npm start to start the development server. The app should open at localhost:3000.

### What I would have done with more time

-Implement that one missing functionality
-Improved styling of dark mode
-fix small styling bug with header and footer I've noticed that only happens occasionaly for some reason
-Better format and refactor CSS through the use of CSS modules or tailwind
